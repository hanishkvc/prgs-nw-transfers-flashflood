logic to transfer things over a nw across multiple entities at the same time

seem to have misplaced my git repo. if I dont find it soon enough, then I will release a new version from the src backup which I have, with a updated challenge response logic, if anyone is using my previous release to friends, bcas this (inc previous release) was just a proof of concept experiment, so didnt bother with a sufficiently robust rc ;) logic.
